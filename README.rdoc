== Group Ride Web Application

If you are a serious cyclist then you spend countless hours training by yourself. You probably often see friends, acquanintances, or strangers riding. Do you ever wish you would have know what their ride plans were and be able to train with them? Personally I always wanted something to make finding training buddies easier.

Group Ride [alpha name] is my solution to this problem. No more email lists or lost Facebook posts. Now you can post your rides or search for rides in your area.
