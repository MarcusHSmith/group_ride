    <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>BikePartyUP is a project build by <a href="http://www.marcushsmith.com/">Marcus Smith</a> to connect cyclist.</p> 
<p>For years cyclist have searched email groups and internet groups for rides. Sifting through the unrealated events and looking for something near them at their level. BikePartyUP seeks to solve this issue by allowing users to easily create and find ride that fit their needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/_mhsmith_">@_mhsmith_</a> has been racing since he was 10 and is now going to school at UC Berkeley. This is a side project originally used to learn Ruby on Rails and is now an exciting experiment. I hope you and enjoy it and I appreciate any feedback.</p>
